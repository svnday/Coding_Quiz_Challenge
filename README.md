# Coding Quiz Challenge
This app is for Module 4: Web APIs  in my full stack web developer bootcamp.

This is a website that provides the user with a quiz of a few code-themed questions. While the quiz is running, there is a dynamic timer in the top corner that also serves as the user's score. When a question is incorrect, time is deducted. Once all of the questions have been answered, the remaining time is the user's score.

Scores are then saved and can be viewed in the high scores page.

## User Story

```
